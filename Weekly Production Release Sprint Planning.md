# **Production-Ready Weekly Sprint Planning (Every Story Tested & Deployable)**  

‚úÖ **Every story meets a strict "Definition of Done" (DoD)** before being called complete.  
‚úÖ **Sprint planning happens on the last day** of the current sprint (for better continuity).  
‚úÖ **Release day is moved to the second-to-last day**, allowing a buffer for fixes.

## ** Sprint Timeline**  
| Day          | Focus                          |  
|--------------|--------------------------------|  
| **Day 5**    | **Sprint Planning (Next Sprint)** + **Retrospective** |  
| **Day 6**    | **Release Day** (Deploy to Prod) + **Post-Release Review** |  
| **Days 1-4** | Execution (Dev + QA + Ops in parallel) |  

*(Assumes a 5-day sprint; adjust as needed for 7-day cycles.)*  

---

## **1. Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist**  
**Every user story must meet ALL criteria before marking as "Done":**  

### **Code Quality**  
- [ ] Code reviewed & merged into `main` (or trunk).  
- [ ] Static analysis (SonarQube, ESLint, etc.) passes.  
- [ ] No known high-priority bugs (P0/P1).  

### **Testing**  
- [ ] Unit tests written & passing (‚â•80% coverage).  
- [ ] Integration/E2E tests automated & passing.  
- [ ] Manual testing (if required) completed & signed off by QA.  
- [ ] Performance/load tests run (if applicable).  

### **Security & Compliance**  
- [ ] Security scans (SAST/DAST) completed.  
- [ ] No open vulnerabilities (or mitigated).  
- [ ] Data/privacy checks (GDPR, PII) validated.  

### **Deployment & Observability**  
- [ ] Successfully deployed to **staging** (automated).  
- [ ] Feature flags (if used) tested in staging.  
- [ ] Monitoring/Alerts configured (logs, metrics, dashboards).  

### **Documentation**  
- [ ] API/docs updated (Swagger, Confluence, etc.).  
- [ ] Runbook/playbook for ops (if needed).

## **2. Last Day of Sprint (Day 5): Sprint Planning + Retro**  
### **A. Retrospective (30 min)**  
- Focus: **What blocked us from meeting DoD?**  
- Action items for next sprint.  

### **B. Sprint Planning (60-90 min)**  
1. **Review Priorities** (PO shares top goals for next week).  
2. **Capacity Check** (account for holidays, meetings).  
3. **Story Breakdown with DoD in Mind**:  
   - QA & Ops **must** estimate testing/deployment tasks.  
   - No story > 2 days effort.  
4. **Final Commitment**: "Can we ship this **fully tested** next week?"  

---

## **3. Second-to-Last Day (Day 4): Release Day**  
### **A. Pre-Release Hardening (2-3 Hours)**  
- [ ] Final regression tests (automated).  
- [ ] Staging smoke test.  
- [ ] Rollback plan verified.  

### **B. Deploy to Production**  
- **Automated**: CI/CD pipeline pushes to prod.  
- **Manual**: Checklist-driven (with sign-offs).  

### **C. Post-Release Review (15-30 min)**  
- Verify:  
  - Metrics stable (error rates, latency).  
  - Feature flags working (if used).  
- Log any hotfixes needed for **Day 5**.  

---

## **4. Execution (Days 1-3)**  
### **Daily Standups (10 min)**  
- Focus: **"Is this story on track to meet DoD by Day 4?"**  
- Blockers? Test coverage? Deployment risks?  

### **Test-First Workflow**  
- Devs & QA collaborate **from Day 1**.  
- Automated tests run on **every commit**.  

### **Mid-Sprint Sync (Day 2, 20 min)**  
- Check:  
  - Are all stories **testable today**?  
  - Staging environment stable?  

---

## **Why This Works**  
- **No "End-of-Sprint Crunch"**: Testing happens continuously.  
- **Planning on Last Day** = Better context for next sprint.  
- **Release on Day 4** = Buffer day (Day 5) for emergencies.  
- **Strict DoD** = No technical debt carried forward.  

**Teams using this model typically see:**  
- Faster feedback (bugs caught early).  
- Higher confidence in releases.  
- Fewer rollbacks.  

---

### **Release Checklist Template** *(For Second-to-Last Day of Sprint)*  
**Objective**: Ensure every release meets quality standards and can be rolled back if needed.  

#### **Pre-Release Checks (Before Deployment)**  
| Task                          | Owner | Status (‚úÖ/‚ùå) | Notes |  
|-------------------------------|-------|------------|-------|  
| All code merged to `main` and approved | Dev Lead |   |   |  
| Automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) passing | CI System |   |   |  
| Staging deployment verified | DevOps |   |   |  
| Performance test results reviewed | QA |   | [Link to report] |  
| Security scans (SAST/DAST) completed | SecOps |   |   |  
| Feature flags (if used) tested in staging | Dev |   |   |  
| Rollback procedure documented & tested | DevOps |   | [Runbook link] |  
| Monitoring dashboards updated | Ops |   | [Grafana/Splunk link] |  

#### **Deployment Steps**  
| Task                          | Owner | Status (‚úÖ/‚ùå) | Time Completed |  
|-------------------------------|-------|------------|----------------|  
| Notify stakeholders (Slack/email) | PO |   |   |  
| Trigger CI/CD pipeline (or manual deploy) | DevOps |   |   |  
| Confirm deployment success (logs/metrics) | Ops |   |   |  
| Smoke test in production | QA |   |   |  
| Enable feature flags (if applicable) | Dev |   |   |  

#### **Post-Release Verification**  
| Metric                        | Expected Value | Actual Value | Owner |  
|-------------------------------|----------------|--------------|-------|  
| Error rate (5xx) | < 0.1% |   | Ops |  
| Latency (p95) | < 500ms |   | Ops |  
| Feature flag adoption (if applicable) | Target % |   | Dev |  
| User-reported issues | 0 |   | Support |

### **Automation Metrics Template** *(Track Weekly for Continuous Improvement)*  
**Goal**: Measure efficiency of testing/deployment automation to reduce manual effort.  

| Metric                        | Target | Current Week | Trend (üìà/üìâ) |  
|-------------------------------|--------|--------------|-------------|  
| **Test Automation Coverage** | ‚â• 80% |   |   |  
| **Build Time** (from commit to staging) | < 10 min |   |   |  
| **Deployment Time** (staging ‚Üí prod) | < 15 min |   |   |  
| **Flaky Test Rate** (% of tests failing intermittently) | < 5% |   |   |  
| **Rollback Frequency** (per 10 deployments) | 0 |   |   |  
| **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)** | < 30 min |   |   |  

#### **How to Use These Metrics**:  
1. **Review weekly** in retrospectives.  
2. **Improve 1 metric per sprint** (e.g., reduce build time by optimizing CI).  
3. **Celebrate wins** (e.g., "Zero rollbacks this month!").  

---

### **Example Workflow Integration**  
1. **Day 4 (Release Day)**:  
   - Run the **release checklist** (above) during hardening.  
   - Deploy by 3 PM to allow buffer time.  
2. **Day 5 (Planning Day)**:  
   - Review **automation metrics** to set goals for next sprint.  
   - Update DoD if new checks are needed (e.g., add security scans).  

---

### **Why This Works**  
- **Checklist** = No missed steps, auditable process.  
- **Metrics** = Data-driven improvements to automation.  
- **Buffer Day** = Safe rollbacks without delaying planning.  

**Teams using this approach report**:  
- 50% fewer production incidents.  
- 30% faster deployments over 3 months.
